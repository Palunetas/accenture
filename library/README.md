 Accenture Spring Boot learning/practice initiative
## This repository has the basic maven based Spring Boot project, the idea is to build upon this simple project. 
Apply the following steps to pull and push your changes into your teamÂ´s corresponding branch.
### Clone this repository - If you see this file most likely you have already checked out this repository, if not execute the following command in CMD:
After you open the command line, place the following and hit enter:
* git clone git@github.com:SpringGrowthChallenge/library.git

### Once cloned, in the command line, execute:
* git pull
* git checkout main
* git checkout -b Equipo{X}_{Y} //Replace X with your team number and Y with the level of the project you will start working on.
  After you execute this command you will be left with your new branch Equipo1_1 created on your local and set to start coding.

### After implementing the requirements for the current level, do a push to deliver your source code with the following commands:
 * git push origin [name of current branch] // for example Equipo1_1
 * git commit -m "comments" //In comments write something meaningfull sucha as "Level 1 completed"
 
# Introduction to Spring Boot: Bean Level

## Project Description
This project is the first level of a six-level learning program designed to introduce developers to the fundamental concepts of Spring Boot. 
The Bean Level focuses on two crucial aspects: Spring Boot Validations and Dependency Injection.

These topics have been covered in the following presentation.
